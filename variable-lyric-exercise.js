// Declare a variable of your choice and assign it a string that's exactly the same as the variable name, 
// but enclosed in quotation marks so JavaScript recognizes it as a string. 
// Then code an alert, specifying the variable, not the string, as the message.

var lyric;

alert(lyric);

// outputs Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
